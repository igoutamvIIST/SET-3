/*
Given an array A of size N where, 1<= N <= 10^5. The task is to find the OR of all possible sub-arrays of A and then the OR of all these results.

Examples:
Input : 1 4 6
Output : 7

All possible subarrays are
{1}, {1, 4}, {4, 6} and {1, 4, 6}
ORs of these subarrays are 1, 5, 6
and 7. OR of these ORs is 7.

Input : 10 100 1000
Output : 1006
(Note: This question can also be asked in this way: after finding ORs of subarrays just return all
distinct values of ORs)
